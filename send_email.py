Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to submit my application for the Senior QA Engineer role. With more than 3 years of experience in quality assurance and software testing, I have honed my skills in both manual and automated testing methodologies.

My proficiency encompasses tools like Selenium, Robot Framework, Postman, TestNG, Locust (for load testing), and JIRA. I possess practical experience in test planning, execution, automation of regression and API tests, and effective defect management within agile settings. In my past positions, my contributions have significantly enhanced product quality, expanded automation coverage, and ensured dependable, scalable releases.

I am confident that my technical expertise and process-oriented mindset can bring value to your QA team. Please find my resume attached for your review, and I am open to further discussions at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Chirag Khanduja
